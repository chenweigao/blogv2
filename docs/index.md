## Getting Started

1. **Browse by Category**: Use the navigation menu to explore different knowledge domains
2. **Search**: Use the search functionality to quickly find specific topics
3. **Navigate**: Each article includes a table of contents for easy navigation
4. **Contribute**: Add your own insights and learnings to build your knowledge base

## Key Improvements in This Reorganization

- **Clearer Categories**: Six well-defined domains instead of mixed classifications
- **Logical Grouping**: Related content is now properly grouped together
- **Consistent Structure**: Standardized naming and organization across all categories
- **Better Navigation**: Hierarchical structure makes finding content easier
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate content across different sections
